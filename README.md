## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Media query


### What I learned
This challenge is my first project outside of the tutorials and I learned to use media queries in this challenge.

The hardest thing for me while doing the challenge was trying to center the container. I tried using a margin of 50%, but the last time I got 36% by trial and error. Is there a formula or method for this? I'll be happy if you can help me.



### Continued development

I want to improve myself in the field of css by dealing with challenges other than tutorials and also make challenges related to javascript in the future.
